# King County House Sales Dashboard

This Tableau dashboard visualizes real estate data for house sales in King County. It provides insights into various aspects of the housing market, including price trends, house characteristics, and location-based sales data. The dashboard allows users to interact with filters such as house size, number of bedrooms, price range, and more to explore the dataset in detail.

## Key Features:
**Interactive Filters**: Refine data by house features like square footage, price, and location.
**Price Trends**: Visual representation of how house prices vary across different regions and time periods.
**Sales Distribution**: Heatmaps to showcase where most of the sales are concentrated geographically.

This project showcases my ability to create data-driven visualizations using Tableau and provides actionable insights into housing market dynamics.
